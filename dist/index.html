    <h2>A fantastic trip to a magic place</h2>
    <p>Buenos Aires, known as the “Paris of South America”, lives up to its nickname with an overwhelming café culture, grand boulevards, and food scene to rival its European counterpart.<br>
      The city is a hot spot for those who love music, food, dancing, and just all-around beautiful, warm, and friendly people.<br>
      Visiting Buenos Aires is an incredible experience. Here you’ll find history, beautiful architecture, verdant parks, quirky book stores, and fantastic nightlife, particularly if you like clubs that open at 2am.<br>
      This is a city that rises late and stays out late.<br>
      When you travel to Buenos Aires, you’ll find the quality of life is very high here and during my stay, I just floated from cafe to cafe, park to park, and wine bar to wine bar! Explore the markets, the many bookshops and cafes, and just relax!

      <h2>Must see in Buenos Aires</h2>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>Cementerio de la Recoleta</strong></li>
        <p class="par">Meander through the maze of narrow lanes lined with elaborate mausoleums in what must be the world's most ostentatious necropolis. This 'city of the dead' was BA's first public cemetery, though it quickly became exclusive; some of Argentina's most illustrious historical figures are buried here.</p>
        <br>
        <li><strong>Plaza de Mayo</strong></li>
        <p class="par">Founded in 1580, Plaza de Mayo is the stage on which many of the dramatic events in Argentina's history were played out, from military bombings in 1955 to Evita's emotional speeches to massive union demonstrations (still going today).</p>
        <br>
        <li><strong>Strolling through San Telmo</strong></li>
        <p class="par">The neighborhood of San Telmo is a beguiling mix of faded grandeur and bohemian spirit. The elegant belle-epoque architecture and crumbling villas are throwbacks to the district's 19th-century heyday, before yellow fever and cholera sent the aristocratic masses to higher ground.</p>

    <h2 id="des"><strong>Buenos Aires combines faded colonial architecture with Latin passion.<br> Sexy and alive, this beautiful city gets under your skin.</strong></h2>
    <h3>Steak, Wine & Ice Cream</h3>
    <p class="desc">BA's food scene is increasingly dynamic, but for many travelers it's the city's carnivorous pleasures that shine. Satisfying a craving for juicy steaks isn't hard to do in the land that has perfected grilling wonderfully flavorful sides of beef, washed down with a generous glass of malbec or bonarda. Parrillas (steakhouses) sit on practically every corner and will offer up myriad cuts, from bife de chorizo (sirloin) to vacio (flank steak) to ojo de bife (rib eye). But leave room for ice cream, if you can – a late-night cone of dulce de leche (caramel) helado can't be topped.</p>
    <h3>Art & Architecture</h3>
    <p class="desc">Look closely: this city is beautiful. Sure, it might look like a concrete jungle from certain angles, but stroll through the streets, paying attention to the architecture around you, and you'll soon be won over. French- and Italian-style palaces grab the limelight, but you'll see interesting architectural details in the buildings of even low-key, local barrios. These days the beauty of these traditional neighborhoods is further enhanced by colorful murals painted by artists involved in the city's vibrant street-art scene. For these talented individuals, the city is their canvas.</p>
    <h3>Nightlife</h3>
    <p class="desc">Take a disco nap, down some coffee and be prepared to stay up all night – this city doesn't sleep. Restaurants get going at 9pm, bars at midnight and clubs at 2am at the earliest; serious clubbers don't show up until 4am. And it's not just the young folk who head out on the town in this city; BA's diverse range of bars, clubs and live-music venues offers something for everyone, from DJs spinning electronica to live jazz sets. Just remember you'll be doing it all very late.</p>
    <h3>Tango</h3>
    <p class="desc">BA's famous dance is possibly the city's greatest contribution to the outside world, a steamy strut that's been described as 'making love in the vertical position'. Folklore says it began in the bordellos of long-ago Buenos Aires, when men waiting for their 'ladies' passed time by dancing among themselves. Today, glamorized tango shows are supremely entertaining with their grand feats of athleticism. You'll also find endless venues for perfecting your moves, from milongas (dance salons) to dance schools. Be aware that some people become addicted – and can spend a lifetime perfecting this sensual dance.</p>
